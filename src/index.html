	<p>
		Tabbing pages with JavaScript offers several benefits.
	</p>
	<h2>
		Improved UX
	</h2>
	<p>
		Users can navigate between different sections of content without reloading the page,
		making the interaction smoother and faster.
	</p>
	<h2>
		Reduced Server Load
	</h2>
	<p>
		Since the content is loaded dynamically, it reduces the number of requests to the server,
		improving performance and reducing server load.
	</p>
	<h2>
		Enhanced Interactivity
	</h2>
	<p>
		JavaScript allows for more interactive and dynamic content, such as animations and transitions, which can make
		the application more engaging.
	</p>
	<h2>
		Better Organization
	</h2>
	<p>
		Tabbing helps in organizing content into manageable sections, making it easier for users to find and access the
		information they need.
	</p>
	<h2>
		Single Page Application (SPA) Development
	</h2>
	<p>
		Tabbing is a common feature in SPAs, which aim to provide a more fluid and responsive user experience by loading
		content dynamically without full page reloads.
